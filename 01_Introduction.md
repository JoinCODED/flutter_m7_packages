In this example, we will create a weather app, and we will learn how to use packages. Also, we will get familiar with the HTTP request.

We will learn how to use:

- **Packages**
- **HTTP Request**
- **Stack widget**
- **Drawer widget**





1. Download the starter project from GitHub, then open the project by using the VS Code, and get the packages.

   > https://github.com/Northwest-content/flutter_weather_app_starter



2. Inside the **Pages** folder, you will find three pages that you will use in the Weather app.
   1. **home_page.dart**, here you will find the user interface for the home screen, and inside it, there will be a text field for searching the city.
   2. **weather_page.dart**, here we will display the weather temperature.
   3. **about_page.dart**, here you will find a static page showing who is the developer of the application, we will use this page when we get to know about the Drawer widget.
