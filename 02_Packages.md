# Packages



In some cases, while you are developing your application, you will find yourself that you will need to use some services such as Bluetooth, GPS, Camera, etc. Here we will use some packages that will help us use these services. Also, the beautiful thing about the packages is that sometimes we do not need to develop some tools from scratch because there is another developer who developed these tools and published them to the general developers.



3. Open https://pub.dev in your browser

> On this website, you will find the packages that will help you to develop your application by using Flutter.



4. Inside the site, you will find a lot of packages.

   such as,

    - **Camera**: a Flutter plugin for iOS and Android allowing access to the device cameras.
      - https://pub.dev/packages/camera
    - **geolocator:** a Flutter geolocation plugin that provides easy access to platform specific location services.
      - https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator
    - **sensors_plus:** a Flutter plugin to access the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors.
      - https://pub.dev/packages/sensors_plus
    - **url_launcher:** a Flutter plugin for launching a URL.
      - https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher





5. In the case of the weather application that we will develop in this lesson, we will need to add the **HTTP** package, and we will know more about what is **HTTP**, but just type in the search box “**HTTP**”.
